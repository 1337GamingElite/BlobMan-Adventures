# BlobMan-Adventures
A "Realm of the Mad God" style RPG. Note: I'm somewhat of a beginner at Java. Also, I followed the Cherno Project's tutorials to make this.

Feel free to mess around with this code for yourself, just note that I'll try to implement my own things so that I can better understand Java.

Also, I apoligize for the poor sprite graphics, feel free to change them.

P.S: Levels are made by an image where each pixel colour represents a certain tile. Here are the hex colours for each tile:

(Hex codes without aplha)  
GRASS = 00ff00  
ROCK = 7a7a7a  
DIRT = ffa800  
WATER = 0000ff  
BUSH = 009900  
WOOD_FLOOR = ff00ff  
STONE_WALL = 000000  
YELLOW_FLOWER = ffff00  
BLUE_FLOWER = 00ffff  

I will update this list if there are any changes.
